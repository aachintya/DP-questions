## Tips for Practicing

1. **Understand the Patterns:** Even though the questions are shuffled, try to identify the underlying DP patterns as you solve each problem. This will help reinforce your understanding.

2. **Time Management:** Allocate specific time slots each day dedicated to solving these problems to maintain consistency.

3. **Review and Revise:** After solving, revisit the problems after a few days to ensure you've retained the concepts.

4. **Seek Help When Stuck:** Utilize resources like [LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/) or [Solution Videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=leetcode+dp+solutions) if you find yourself stuck.

5. **Track Your Progress:** Consider maintaining a spreadsheet to track which problems you've solved and any notes or optimizations you've discovered.

Good luck with your continued practice, and keep up the great work on your DP journey!
